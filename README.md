Stanford Research Systems (SRS) does not provide software to control remotely their lock-in amplifiers (LIAs).

A set of Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs were developed in Matlab to remote control of the devices.
The programs allow users to configure the devices and introduce a graphic plot for continuous measurement of signals.
Two GUIs were available, one for the LIA SR830 model and another for the LIAs SR860 and SR865Am models.
The applications were test with the SR830 and SR865Am models using only the serial port interface.
